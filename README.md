- 👋 Hi, I’m Federico García Cendra, from Argentina, but you can call me @xTorettox in here
- 👀 I’m interested in problem solving and coming up with digital solutions for web users. I recently discovered svelte and sveltekit and I must say I loved it!
- 🌱 I’m currently learning javascript, svelte, sveltekit, and a bit of prisma ORM
- 💞️ I’m new at programming, so I'm looking to collaborate on any project that helps me learn how to fullstack nice :) 
- 📫 You can reach me at fg.garciacendra@gmail.com, or on LinkedIn: /in/fgarciacendra/
